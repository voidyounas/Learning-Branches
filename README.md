# Branches#

    Learning branches on the github for collaborative coding and projects

# Concepts#

    The concepts of pull requests , branches , merging and reviewing is used in this and later on will work more to master it

# Merging#

    The branches will be later merged to the master/main branch after so many PRs and checking and will confirm to merge the branches to the main/master

---

# Conflict#

    Sometimes it may cause a conflict due to same work so it'll warn you and asks you which branch to be accepted to be merged

    ***Really good and effecient ways to work collectively***

# Branches

Learning branches on GitHub for collaborative coding and team projects.
In this repo, I'll learn about branches and will add different codes just
for learning, and practice.

## Concepts

This project focuses on:

- **Pull Requests (PRs)**
- **Branching strategies**
- **Merging workflow**
- **Code review practices**

I will continue exploring these to gain full mastery.

---

## Merging

All working branches will eventually be merged into the `main` or `master` branch **after proper PR reviews and approvals**.  
This ensures clean and stable updates to the main project.

---

## Conflicts

Sometimes, **merge conflicts** may occur when different branches change the same lines of code.  
Git will alert you and ask which version to keep â€” a valuable part of collaboration!

## Source

Huge thanks to my mentor and best senior **Ahmad Bhai** for teaching me all this.
You don't need a 3 4 hrs tutorials--just sit , focus , learn , execute , practice
